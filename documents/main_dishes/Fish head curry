Fish head curry is a Singaporean dish deriving from a hybrid of Indian and Chinese ethnic cuisines. The head of a red snapper is stewed in a curry with assorted vegetables such as okra and eggplants. It is usually served with either rice or bread, or as a shared dish.

=== Origins ===
Fish head curry was invented in Singapore when a chef from the state of Kerala named M.J. Gomez, who was living in the country, wanted to bring South Indian cuisine to local diners. He started a restaurant called Gomez Curry, which was located at Sophia Road and eventually at 9 Selegie Road, both located within the Rochor district in the Central Region.Although fish head was not widely served in the Indian subcontinent, Chinese customers considered Fish head casserole as a special delicacy, and so Gomez had the idea of cooking the fish in curry instead, as well as his own ingredients, therefore formulating a new dish.Today, restaurants of all races in the country all serve variations of this dish. Fish head curry has become a popular dish among Singaporeans and tourists alike. Costing between S$10 to S$20, it is generally not considered cheap hawker fare. It typically comes served in a clay pot, and is often sold at hawker centers and neighbourhood food stalls.


== Preparation ==
Tamarind (asam) juice is frequently added to the gravy to give the dish a sweet-sour flavor (see asam fish). This variety of fish head curry also has a thinner, orange gravy.Coconut milk can be added to this dish.
