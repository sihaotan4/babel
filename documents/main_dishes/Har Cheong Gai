Har cheong gai (simplified Chinese: 虾酱鸡; traditional Chinese: 蝦醬雞; pinyin: xiā jiàng jī; lit. 'shrimp paste chicken'), is a Singaporean fried chicken dish, consisting of fried chicken wings in a batter with fermented shrimp paste.


== Description ==
Har cheong gai is regarded as one of the most popular family fried chicken dishes in Singapore, and is made with fermented shrimp paste (har cheong) and a host of other spices and ingredients. The shrimp paste used is distinct to the paste used for rojak sauce, but rather a pinkish grey southeastern Chinese style. 
The recipe for har cheong gai differs from other fried chicken recipes in that the marinade and the batter are not separate; rather wheat flour and potato or corn starch is added to the marinade, creating a seasoned batter. Depending on the recipe followed this is done at the very startor just prior to frying after the chicken has been allowed to marinate, in both cases the chicken is often allowed to marinate overnight.


== Har cheong gai burger ==
