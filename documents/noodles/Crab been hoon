Crab bee hoon (Chinese: 螃蟹米粉; pinyin: pángxiè mífěn) is a Singaporean rice vermicelli dish with whole mud crab served in a claypot and spiced milky broth. Bee Hoon or rice noodle has the ability to soak up the stock from any dish and that's the reason it is so popular among the locals. There's also a dry version, where thinner rice noodles are tossed in a hot wok before stewing in a broth until every strand is permeated with similar sweetness.

He's also describing its crab bee hoon as “giant Sri Lankan beasts cooked with a spicy mystery sauce and noodles — pure messy indulgence.”
